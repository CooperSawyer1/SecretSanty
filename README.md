# Welcome to Secret Santy. 
  The goal of this project was to make a secret santa website.


## Description
  This app is designed to make it easier for you to know exactly what someone wants for christmas. I wanted to create a secret santa app that would allow people to pick their presents they wanted and allow others to see them. I used rails because it allows both front end and back end capabilities. I used a basic authorization for signing up, logging in and logging out so you can keep track of your own gifts. This app currently allows you to create a profile, log in and log out, add presents to your list and view your list as well as a link to an external website where you can purchase the item. 
  A challenge I faced was halfway through the project I had to start over which is why it is not as far along as I would like it to be. In the future
  I want to add a secret santa list, which will let the user add themselves to a list, once the list is complete an administrator will then randomize it and you see who you are paired with and what they want for the holidays. You can be an administrator who also creates a list, sends a link to the people on the list and it will allow them to create their list of gifts and see who they are purchasing for.

## Installation
  To use this app you need to clone to repo to your local environment, start the server and it navigate to the root "/" directory and enjoy!

## Conclusion
  I would like to thank Sebastian Kopp, Gillian Wenhold, Hayden Rouille, Ezz Abousaif, Ivan Candido and Dion Theroulde with their help on this project. They were huge in helping me through the process of this app as well as helping me restart the entire thing on Thursday.
